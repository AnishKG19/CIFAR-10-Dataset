# CIFAR-10-Dataset
It takes the CIFAR-10 dataset which consist of 60,000 images which is divided into 10 classes.
I have made a model which takes a total of 50,000 images as the training datset to learn and understand that particular images belongs to which class.
The rest 10,000 images is feed as a test dataset which will feed into my code and predicts that it belongs to which class out of 10.
